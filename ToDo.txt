--Project Brief--
Blog Website
    -Create an interactive blog website: the topic is of your choice, but it needs to meet the following requirements
        -A dark/light mode toggle (done)
        -A blog page with at least one post already made(within HTML)
        -A form with 3 fields to add a new blog entry(done)
            -Title
            -Author
            -Entry(to write the content)
        -A submit button that validates the form through Javascript
        -A consistent navigation bar on all pages (done)
        -At least 3 pages (Landing page explaining who you are and what the site is all about. A blog page for blog posts. A Contact page for sending the website owner an email) (done)
Challenge User Stories
    -As a user I would like the blog posts to read from an external file so that I can read all the posts sent.
    -As a user I would like all blogs to be date stamped with todays date and time so that I can see when posts were made.
    -As a user I would like the browser to alert me when I have posted a blog or sent an email via the Contact Us page so I know my post has been successful.
Success Criteria
    -All code is explicitly clean and easy to read, with all W3C coding standards met and created to a professional standard.
    -A complex layout made using a flex and/or grid
    -Javascript has been implemented successfully and without scripting errors
    -The website is updated through form submission, without breaking the original code or layout.

My website idea is to create an art blog showcasing my artwork. I will explain the materials used and the process involved, while also encouraging other artists to share their work. The contact form will include options such as: - Commission request - Question - Comment, and maybe more.

Bonus points: Adding a blog at the top of the page, not the bottom (you could even try filtering blogs/searching/ordering with filter options)
Bonus points: Deleting a blog post
